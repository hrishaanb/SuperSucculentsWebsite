  <h5 class="blah"> Care tips </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
  <paragraph class="stuff" id="left-alignment"> - Do <paragraph class="bold">NOT</paragraph> overwater these succulents or else the soil will get too moist and the succulent will die
<br><br>
- When watering the Deluxe Especial (if you want, you can do it with the clay version too), use a syringe with a pointed tip and direct the water near the succulent roots
<br><br>
- Rotate your succulent pot frrequently so that not just one side of the succulent gets light (and make sure to have it in the light!)
<br><br>
- Keep the succulents clean by using a thin brush and brush the leaves because succulents pick up dust from the floor and it will inhibit their growth
<br><br>
- (Optional) Use a moisture/water meter to check if you need to water the succulent (watering about 1-2 times a week should be fine) or if it has too much water in it (succulents are at about a 3 on the moisture meter)
